## Week 9

### Summary

- **Achievements**:
  - Completed implementing K-Nearest Neighbours for Chess and Phishing Dataset
  - Started the implementation of MLP on all the three datasets - Chess, Phishing, CloudCast

### References

- 

### Challenges

1.  We were still encountering issues with the CloudCast dataset
	-  We were not able to come up with a proper solution for this, we were suggested that we can code each image from that dataset separately.

### Next Steps

- Solve the issues related to implementation of models on CloudCast dataset
- Perform Classification on Phishing, and Chess dataset.
- Implement perceptron on Phishing, and Chess dataset.
