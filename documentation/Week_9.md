## Week 9

### Summary

- **Achievements**:
  - Completed implementing K-Nearest Neighbours for Chess and Phishing Dataset
  - Started the implementation of MLP on all the three datasets - Chess, Phishing, CloudCast

### Challenges

1.  We were still encountering issues with the CloudCast dataset - every pixel was labelled with labels defined from 0-10 which represented the transparency of the cloud, this caused issues with classification
	-  We were not able to come up with a proper solution for this, we were suggested that we can make a python script, run it through the dataset and let it count what the majority cloud type is in the dataset - then can make a new dataset of this majority which would be unlabelled.


### Next Steps

- Solve the issues related to implementation of models on CloudCast dataset
- Perform Classification on Phishing, and Chess dataset.
- Implement perceptron on Phishing, and Chess dataset.
