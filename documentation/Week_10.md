### Challenges

1. Tried solving the issues of the CloudCast dataset with the suggestion we were given but was unsuccessful
	- We decided that the last resort would be to change the dataset even though it was a little late since this dataset was not allowing us to implement our models successfully.

### Next Steps

- Complete implementation of perceptron on Phishing, and Chess dataset.
- Search up other image dataset that could help us replace the CloudCast dataset.
