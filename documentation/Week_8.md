### Challenges

1. Implementing CNN was causing some issues in CloudCast Dataset
	- Professor asked us to discuss about this the following week
2.  Implementing these models was taking very long hours on the Phishing Dataset, since it is a huge dataset
     - Professor suggested we take a smaller subset of the dataset and implement the models on that subset

### Next Steps

-  Complete implementing CNN for CloudCast Dataset
- Implement K-Nearest Neighbours for Chess, CloudCast and Phishing Dataset
