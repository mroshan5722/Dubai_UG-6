## Week 11

### Summary

- **Achievements**:
  - Completed the implementation of perceptron on Phishing, and Chess dataset.
  - Found an image dataset to replace the CloudCast dataset. (Traffic Sign dataset)
  - Started model implementation on the new Traffic Sign dataset.
  - Implementation of Naive Bayes completed on Phishing Dataset.
  - Started working on documentation.

### Challenges

1. We were unable to complete the entire model implementation on the new Traffic Sign dataset, since our initial CloudCast dataset had to be replaced very close to the CW submission deadline.
	- We split the work amongst ourselves to help get the tasks done.
2.  We needed to wait for a long time for the CNN to be implemented on the new datset since the kernel would take time.
     - There was not much we could do for this.     
3. We had all the information needed for the documentation but were unable to complete it,  since we have a page limit of 6 and the information we had was exceeding the page limit. We also need to wait for the implementation to be completed on the new dataset.
     - We made a draft with only the very important information that would be needed to be documented.
